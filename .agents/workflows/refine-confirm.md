# Refine Confirm Branch

## Entry Condition

Run with a resolved provider, complete official parent item, and preserved
`needs-refinement` findings.

---

## Steps

### 1. Draft the Decomposition

Follow `./sub-agent.md` with:

```text
task_context:
  parent_item: complete official parent item
  needs_refinement_findings: preserved refinement findings
```

Keep the selected specialist as sole author. It may inspect user- or
item-identified technical context read-only.

Have it load `../skills/to-tickets/SKILL.md` completely and run only Steps 1–3
through `Draft vertical slices`. Require at least two provider-neutral children
with stable references, meaningful titles, Markdown bodies, and genuine
blocking edges when applicable.

Tracker setup is not required for this draft-only invocation. Return every
blocking edge as:

```text
blocked_ref: stable reference of the child that waits
blocking_ref: stable reference of the child that must complete first
```

The children must be autonomous vertical slices covering the parent scope
exactly once. Return the draft to `/refine` before Step 4 of `to-tickets`;
`/refine` owns confirmation and provider operations.

### 2. Review the Decomposition

Verify the Step 1 contract and an acyclic blocking graph containing only valid,
non-self references and genuine blockers. Return failures with the complete
draft to the same specialist, then repeat this step.

### 3. Confirm the Decomposition

Present using `../templates/decomposition-preview.md` with:

```text
children: complete reviewed child proposals with stable references, titles, and bodies
blocking_edges: complete reviewed blocked_ref and blocking_ref pairs, or none
```

Then ask using `../templates/select-option.md` with:

```text
question: What do you want to do with this decomposition?
options:
- Confirm and create all child items
- Adjust the decomposition
- Cancel without changes
```

- `Adjust the decomposition`: return the adjustment and current draft to the
  same specialist, then repeat Step 2.
- `Cancel without changes`: finish according to
  `../goals/refine-complete.md` without mutation.
- `Confirm and create all child items`: preserve the exact latest preview and
  continue.

### 4. Create the Confirmed Decomposition

Follow `./refine-create.md` with:

```text
provider: resolved item provider
parent_item: complete official parent item
children: exact confirmed children in preview order
blocking_edges: exact confirmed blocking edges
```
