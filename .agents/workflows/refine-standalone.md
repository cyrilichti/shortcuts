# Refine Standalone Branch

## Steps

### 1. Resolve Official Parent Context

Run `../commands/resolve-item-provider.md` with:

```text
context: item
```

Then run `../commands/resolve-existing-item.md` with:

```text
provider: resolved item provider
reference: user-provided provider item ID, when available
fields:
  - comments
  - acceptance criteria
  - labels
  - linked resources
  - attachments
```

Use the returned item and provider ID as the complete official parent item
context. Present with `../templates/ticket-summary.md`:

```text
item: complete official parent item
```

### 2. Assess Refinement Need

Run `../commands/assess-refinement-need.md` with:

```text
context: complete official parent item
```

On `refinement-not-needed`, report the rationale and finish according to
`../goals/refine-complete.md`. On `needs-refinement`, keep the exact findings.

### 3. Follow Shared Execution

Follow `./refine-confirm.md` with:

```text
provider: resolved item provider
parent_item: complete official parent item
needs_refinement_findings: exact assessment findings
```
