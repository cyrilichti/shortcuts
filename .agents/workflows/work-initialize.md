# Work Initialize Branch

## Steps

### 1. Require the Default Branch

Read the current branch, locally known remote default branch, and upstream
state without fetching.

Require the current branch to be that default branch and not behind or
diverged from its upstream. Otherwise, ask the user to switch or update it,
then stop. When Git cannot determine the default branch or upstream state, ask
the user to confirm both before continuing.

### 2. Initialize the Branch

Format the branch name with `../templates/branch-name.md` using:

```text
plan_name: exact plan name
plan_objective: exact plan Objective
item_type: official item type, when available
```

Create and switch to the branch, create one empty initialization commit named
from the plan, then push to the current push remote.

### 3. Create the Draft Request

Run `../commands/resolve-version-provider.md`, then
`../commands/resolve-version-repository.md` with:

```text
provider: resolved version provider
push_remote: current push remote
```

Format the title with `../templates/request-title.md` using:

```text
plan_name: exact plan name
item_id: official item ID, when available
```

Run `../commands/create-request.md` with:

```text
provider: resolved version provider
repository: repository derived from the push remote
source_branch: created work branch
target_branch: default branch used for initialization
title: formatted draft request title
```

Keep the complete created request record in the current execution context.

### 4. Link the Official Item

When an official item is available, run
`../commands/resolve-item-provider.md` with `context: item`, then run
`../commands/link-request-to-item.md` with:

```text
provider: resolved item provider
item_id: official item ID
request_kind: created request kind
request_url: created request URL
plan_reference: project-relative authoritative plan file path
```

Return the complete created request record to the caller.

## Safety

- Do not fetch, pull, or update the default branch for the user.
- Do not run a general repository, provider, MCP capability, or backlink
  preflight.
- Link only the newly created request and do not change item status.
- Do not persist Git, provider, or request metadata in the plan.
