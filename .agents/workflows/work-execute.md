# Work Execute Branch

## Steps

### 1. Execute Todos

Treat plan todo states as authoritative. Skip `completed` and `cancelled`, then
select the first `in_progress` todo or mark the first `pending` todo
`in_progress`. Continue to Step 2 when neither exists.

Persist every state transition immediately in the authoritative plan file. Do
not keep todo state only in execution context.

For each active todo:

1. Reuse the active specialist while it remains appropriate. When none is
   active or the todo requires a different agent cohort, follow
   `./sub-agent.md` with:

   ```text
   task_context:
     todo: active todo
     constraints: relevant plan constraints
     technical_context: required technical context
   ```

   Let the selected specialist route only Skills whose profile triggers apply,
   or work directly when none apply.
2. Have the specialist implement and validate only that todo, then stage only
   its changes.
3. Present `../templates/todo-review.md`, then
   `../templates/commit-proposal.md` with one proposed title and description.
4. Ask using `../templates/select-option.md` with:

   ```text
   question: What do you want to do with this commit proposal?
   options:
   - Commit these changes
   - Request an adjustment
   ```

5. On `Request an adjustment`, collect the free-form adjustment and return it
   to the same specialist. Repeat implementation, validation, staging, review,
   and proposal.
6. On `Commit these changes`, create the approved commit without trailers.
   After it succeeds, persist the todo as `completed` without pushing, then
   continue with the next todo.

### 2. Offer Ready

When no todo remains `pending` or `in_progress`, require at least one
`completed` todo. When all todos are `cancelled`, report that no work was
completed and stop without calling `/ready`.

Otherwise, ask using `../templates/select-option.md` with:

```text
question: What do you want to do with this completed work?
options:
- Prepare work for review
- Stop here
```

On `Stop here`, stop without mutation.

On `Prepare work for review`, follow `./ready.md` in caller mode with:

```text
plan: authoritative plan
item: complete official item context, when available
request_id: created request ID, when available
```

When resumed work has no request ID, `/ready` asks for its number or IID. It
owns the direct plan check, one confirmation, and the resulting promotion.

## Safety

- Do not mark a todo `completed` before its approved commit succeeds.
- Do not push todo commits or invoke `/inspect`.
