# retrieve-items

Retrieve ClickUp tasks matching the caller's criteria.

### Current User

1. Resolve the current user to ClickUp user IDs:

   ```text
   tool: clickup_resolve_assignees
   arguments:
     assignees:
       - me
   ```

2. Retrieve assigned tasks:

   ```text
   tool: clickup_filter_tasks
   arguments:
     assignees: resolved numeric user IDs
     include_closed: false
     subtasks: false
   ```

3. Apply the caller criteria to the returned tasks when ClickUp cannot express
   them directly.

Keep the first `limit` matches without requesting another page. Normalize `id`
as `provider_id`, `name` as `title`, and the list label as `destination`.

Use ClickUp status names as workspace-specific values. Do not assume every
workspace uses the same status labels.

Do not call `clickup_search` for this operation when `clickup_filter_tasks` can
retrieve the requested tasks.

### Status Criteria

Use `clickup_filter_tasks` with the caller's resolved `statuses`. Do not pass
`assignees` unless requested.
