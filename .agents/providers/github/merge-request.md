# merge-request

Require writable `merge_pull_request`; otherwise return `unsupported` without
substitution.

```text
tool: merge_pull_request
arguments:
  owner: caller repository owner
  repo: caller repository name
  pullNumber: caller request ID
  merge_method: caller merge method
```

Return the provider result without reading the pull request or normalizing its
delivery state. Do not retry an ambiguous operation.
