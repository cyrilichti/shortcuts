# Link Request to Item

Add one discoverable draft request backlink to an official item.

## Input

- `provider`: resolved item provider.
- `item_id`: official provider item ID.
- `request_kind`: `merge_request` or `pull_request` from the created request.
- `request_url`: newly created request URL.
- `plan_reference`: project-relative authoritative plan file path.

## Comment

For `request_kind: merge_request`:

```text
Draft MR: <request_url>

Agent-Workflows-Plan: <plan_reference>
```

For `request_kind: pull_request`:

```text
Draft PR: <request_url>

Agent-Workflows-Plan: <plan_reference>
```

## Steps

1. Load `../providers/<provider>/add-request-backlink.md`. Stop when it is
   missing.
2. Select the exact comment for `request_kind`. Stop when the kind is not
   supported.
3. Follow the operation with the item ID and exact comment.
4. Return the created backlink.

Do not update item status, title, description, assignment, labels, or any other
item field. Call this command only after creating a new request and never while
resuming existing work.
